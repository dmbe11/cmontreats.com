						Molly has always been a healthy and vibrant dog but when she was still a puppy we discovered when she was given high processed treats, she would have an adverse reaction. In the worst cases she would have severe stomach cramps
						and show she was in pain.</p>

							<p class="text-justify text-white">We quickly realized the treats were to blame and started looking for an alternative. After doing research, I discovered that feeding single ingredient treats might stop the problem. So,
								after testing a few options we discovered freeze dried single ingredient treats.&nbsp; These treats did not cause the issues&nbsp; but I found the quality to be inconsistent and in my opinion they were expensive. We
								thought for what we were paying for these treats we should either get more or&nbsp; higher quality. Then we realized that most of the options were from organ meat, which was really difficult to tell about the quality
								and thought it would be better to start with high quality food&nbsp; that had information regarding where the meat came from..</p>
							<p class="text-justify text-white">After all of this we thought, why don't we make our own and if we could maybe sell them on a small scale. So we started making out own treats from high quality proteinâ€™s like wild caught
								Sockeye salmon, not chum, chicken breast tenderloin fillets, and we even experimented with Wagyu
								beef, but if you every purchased Wagyu beef you know it is not cheap and difficult to get.&nbsp; After, experimenting with different proteins, I narrowed my list to a couple sources that our pets love. We puchase our
								meat
								from the highest quality local sources and keep records of where we source every batch. Try a package or two, your pets&nbsp; will love you for it.</p>
